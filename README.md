## Business Requirements.
I am studying the Full Stack Developer course with Code Institute, I just learned how to use Machine Learning as part of my last project and how to predict future trends which I will be using in my career of a Data Scientist. 
My nice who lives in America started a little real estate business, part of her vision was to buy 6 houses in a small town from Iowa, called Ames. As Ames is known for its robust, stable economy and flourishing cultural environment with a population over 89,540 people, my nice believes that this will be a very good investment in buying some old houses, refurbish them and after selling them at a higher price. 
Overall, my nice has a good understanding of the average prices for the houses in this region, however, because this investment will be very important for her business, she reached out to her uncle who will be able to use the power of machine learning in order to predict the prices for these homes without risking an inaccurate appraisal. 
My nice has conducted research and she found a public dataset for the houses that have been sold over the years and she will be able to share this data with me in order to create an accurate prediction for each of the houses that she plans to sell after refurbishment. 
## Hypothesis and how to validate?
Hypothesis for the sale prices after refurbishment.
-	An evaluation must be conducted on the dataset that has been received from my nice in order to visualise the other houses that have been sold in that area and what is the criteria that influences the pricing, at the same time we have find similar attributes to the 6 houses that my nice will like to sell.
-	The analysis shows that the important factors to determine a house price is highly influenced by the size of each room, starting with the ground floor, leaving room, the first floor, if the house has a basement or a garage. As part of the factors that influence the house prices are the year of construction, the quality of the used materials and the last refurbishments.

## Deployment
## Heroku
•	The App live link is: here
•	The project was deployed to Heroku using the following steps.
1.	Log in to Heroku and create an App
2.	At the Deploy tab, select GitHub as the deployment method.
3.	Select your repository name and click Search. Once it is found, click Connect.
4.	Select the branch you want to deploy, then click Deploy Branch.
5.	The deployment process should happen smoothly in case all deployment files are fully functional. Click now the button Open App on the top of the page to access your App.
